## 🧠 About Me

Hey! I'm Ahmed — I started as a web designer at 15, taught myself how to code at 17, and never looked back.

Now I:
- Build MVPs and SaaS products
- Run my own development agency
- Create content on X (Twitter) to grow my personal brand
- Help clients turn ideas into scalable apps
- Explore AI, cybersecurity & bleeding-edge tech

I believe in shipping fast, learning in public, and building software that actually solves problems.
