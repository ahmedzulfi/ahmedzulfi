## 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

I’m Ahmed — a self-taught developer who went from designing websites at 15 to building full-stack SaaS apps by 17. I love the early stage of software: taking raw ideas and shipping them into working products, fast.

Right now, I’m focused on:
- Building my development agency
- Launching niche SaaS products
- Learning in public and documenting my journey
- Contributing to open-source & collaborating with other builders

## 🧠 Current Focus

These days I’m spending most of my time on:

### 🦷 **Dental Aligner Software (SaaS)**  
Building a platform to help dental clinics manage patient data and aligner progress digitally.  
It’s real-world, B2B, and I’m learning a ton about product design, business logic, and working with clients.

### 🎨 **PfpAvatar**  
AI tool where users upload a photo and get back a clean, cool AI-generated avatar.  
It’s built in **Next.js** with custom backend logic — no boilerplate, no shortcuts.

### 🌍 **Exploring Open Source**  
Open source is something I recently started diving into.  
I’m learning how to contribute, organize my code better, and build tools others can use.  
Planning to ship some small tools for devs, designers, and indie hackers.

## ⚒️ Tech I Use Often

**Frontend**  
React, Next.js, Tailwind, Framer Motion

**Backend**  
Node.js, Express, .NET, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

**Infra & Tools**
